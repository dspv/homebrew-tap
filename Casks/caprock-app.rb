  # The app is ad-hoc signed, not notarized (no Apple Developer ID yet), so
  # Gatekeeper would refuse the first launch and every upgrade. Homebrew has
  # already checked the download against the sha256 above; clear the
  # quarantine flag so Caprock opens like any other app. Drop this once the
  # build is signed and notarized.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Caprock is not notarized yet. This cask clears the download's quarantine
    flag so the app opens normally; if macOS still refuses it, open
    System Settings > Privacy & Security and click "Open Anyway".

    The app bundles the daemon from the same release. If the caprock formula
    is installed (brew install dspv/tap/caprock), the app starts that one
    instead, and `brew upgrade caprock` keeps it current.
